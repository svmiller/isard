`{isard}` contains some data for use in `{peacesciencer}`. CRAN has
understandable, if strict, requirements about package size. Data, more
than functions, push package sizes to their limits. `{isard}` will have
some overflow data for use in `{peacesciencer}`. That package will still
have some data sets, though it will be more about functions going
forward.

# Installation

Ideally, this would be on CRAN. Until then, or if you want development
versions of this package, you can also install it from Github as
follows.

``` r
devtools::install_github("svmiller/isard")
```

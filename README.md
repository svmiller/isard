`{isard}` contains some data for use in `{peacesciencer}`. CRAN has
understandable, if strict, requirements about package size. Data, more
than functions, push package sizes to their limits. `{isard}` will have
some overflow data for use in `{peacesciencer}`. That package will still
have some data sets, though it will be more about functions going
forward. The particular data sets included here will focus mostly on
those lengthy in size (i.e.Â the state-year data sets) and those that may
require some periodic maintenance and updates.

# Installation

Ideally, this would be on CRAN. Until then, or if you want development
versions of this package, you can also install it from Github as
follows.

``` r
devtools::install_github("svmiller/isard")
```

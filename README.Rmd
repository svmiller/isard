`{isard}` contains some data for use in quantitative peace science applications. CRAN has understandable, if strict, requirements about package size. Data, more than functions, push package sizes to their limits. `{isard}` will have some overflow data that could use for a variety of quantitative peace science applications in the R programming language. The particular data sets included here will focus mostly on those lengthy in size (i.e. the state-year data sets) and those that may require some periodic maintenance and updates. Estimates of democracy and economic size/wealth, in particular, are data that are both large in size and improve/extend over time. Those data, and more, are included here.

# Installation

Ideally, this would be on CRAN. Until then, or if you want development versions of this package, you can also install it from Github as follows.

```r
devtools::install_github("svmiller/isard")
```

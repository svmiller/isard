`{isard}` contains some data for use in `{peacesciencer}`. CRAN has understandable, if strict, requirements about package size. Data, more than functions, push package sizes to their limits. `{isard}` will have some overflow data for use in `{peacesciencer}`. That package will still have some data sets, though it will be more about functions going forward. The particular data sets included here will focus mostly on those lengthy in size (i.e. the state-year data sets) and those that may require some periodic maintenance and updates.

# Installation

Ideally, this would be on CRAN. Until then, or if you want development versions of this package, you can also install it from Github as follows.

```r
devtools::install_github("svmiller/isard")
```

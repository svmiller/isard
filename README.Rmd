`{isard}` contains some data for use in `{peacesciencer}`. CRAN has understandable, if strict, requirements about package size. Data, more than functions, push package sizes to their limits. `{isard}` will have some overflow data for use in `{peacesciencer}`. That package will still have some data sets, though it will be more about functions going forward.

# Installation

Ideally, this would be on CRAN. Until then, or if you want development versions of this package, you can also install it from Github as follows.

```r
devtools::install_github("svmiller/isard")
```

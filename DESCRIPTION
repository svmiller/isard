Description: These are data and functions to support quantitative peace science
    research. The data are important state-year information on democracy and
    wealth, which require periodic updates and regular maintenance. The
    functions permit some exploratory and diagnostic assessment of the kinds of
    data in demand by the community, but do not impose many dependencies on the
    user.
